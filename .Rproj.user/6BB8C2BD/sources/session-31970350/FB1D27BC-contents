First I installed the packages with the below commands;

install.packages("tidyverse")
install.packages("nycflights13")

Let's call the packages :

```{r}
library(tidyverse)
library(nycflights13)
```
We can see there are 3,222 rows and 9 columns. We can see the columns names and data type 
```{r}
planes %>% glimpse()
```
Let's see the number of planes belonging to the manufacturers. 

```{r}
planes %>% 
  group_by(manufacturer) %>% 
  summarise(count=n()) %>% 
  arrange(manufacturer) %>% 
  print(n=Inf)

```
Let's get the number of plane numbers for each year

```{r}
planes %>% 
  group_by(year) %>% 
  summarise(count=n()) %>% 
  arrange(year) %>% 
  print(n=Inf)

```
